    <h1>Loaded Smashed Potatoes</h1>
    <p>SUPER CRISPY smashed potatoes topped with sour cream, bacon + chives. The easiest most perfect bite-sized appetizer.</p>
    <p>These are great for any kind of party - we often make them for Super Bowl Sunday.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds baby yellow potatoes</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>¾ cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>4 slices bacon, diced</li>
        <li>⅓ cup sour cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Lightly oil a baking sheet or coat with nonstick spray.</li>
        <li>Place potatoes in a Dutch oven and cover with cold salted water by 1 inch. Bring to a boil and simmer until just tender, about 15 minutes; drain well and let cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Place potatoes onto the prepared baking sheet. Using a flat dry measuring cup or glass, carefully smash the potatoes until flattened but still in one piece. Brush with olive oil; season with salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
        <li>Place into oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until golden brown and crisp. Sprinkle the tops of each potato with cheese; place into oven and bake until cheese has melted, an additional 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium high heat. Add bacon and cook until brown and crispy, about 6-8 minutes. Drain excess fat; transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
        <li>Top each potato with sour cream, bacon and chives.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
